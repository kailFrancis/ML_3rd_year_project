# ML_3rd_year_project


This is the code for my Machine Learning project I did in my 3rd year at Univeristy of Cambridge. Note that due to the time constraints and nature of the tasks, the code is draft.

Project.ipynb includes instructions for each task. CartPole.py includes provided code for some useful functions and classes. The remaining Jupyter Notebooks contain my answers.
